## 🧭 Introduction

A **Deployment** in Kubernetes provides a declarative way to describe the desired state of your application. It ensures the correct number of **Pods** are running, allows for **rolling updates**, and handles **automatic recovery** of failed Pods. This makes it ideal for managing scalable and resilient applications in production.
