# 📘 Day 01 – Introduction to Docker & Kubernetes

---

## 🐳 What is Docker?

**Docker** is an open-source containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into isolated units called **containers**. These containers can run reliably across different environments, ensuring consistency from development to production.

---

## ☸️ What is Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes (K8s)** is an open-source **container orchestration** platform developed by Google. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of machines.

## ⚠️ Problems with Using Docker Alone

### ❌ Problem 1: Single Host Nature

- Containers are **ephemeral** — they can stop or die at any time.
- If a container (e.g., `C1`) consumes too many resources (RAM/CPU), it can crash other containers (e.g., `C100`) on the same host.
- Docker by itself operates on a **single host** and doesn’t provide resource isolation across multiple hosts.

### ❌ Problem 2: No Auto Healing

- If a container fails, the application becomes inaccessible.
- Restarting containers requires **manual intervention**.
- In an environment with hundreds of containers, manual recovery is inefficient and error-prone.

### ❌ Problem 3: No Auto Scaling

- Example: A container with 4GB RAM and 4 CPUs may fail if 10,000 users access the app during peak traffic.
- Docker does **not support horizontal auto scaling** to handle increasing traffic dynamically.

### ❌ Problem 4: Lack of Enterprise-Level Features

Docker does not natively support key enterprise features such as:
- ✅ Load Balancing  
- ✅ Auto Healing  
- ✅ Auto Scaling  
- ✅ Firewall rules per pod  
- ✅ API Gateway Integration

## ✅ How Kubernetes Solves Docker’s Problems

### ✔️ Solves Problem 1: Single Host Limitation

- Kubernetes runs on a **cluster** (a group of nodes).
- If one container is resource-hungry, Kubernetes can **schedule it on a different node**, isolating it from others.

### ✔️ Solves Problem 2: Auto Healing

- Kubernetes automatically restarts, replaces, or reschedules failed containers.
- It ensures high availability **without manual effort**.

### ✔️ Solves Problem 3: Auto Scaling

- Kubernetes supports **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**.
- You can define a replica count in the Deployment YAML.
- Kubernetes scales based on CPU/memory usage or custom metrics.

### ✔️ Solves Problem 4: Enterprise Support

Kubernetes offers full enterprise-level support features:
- ✅ Built-in Load Balancer via Services  
- ✅ TLS termination via Ingress  
- ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- ✅ Observability (monitoring/logging)  
- ✅ Auto Healing & Self-Healing Pods  
- ✅ Auto Scaling  
- ✅ API Gateway integration with Ingress Controllers
