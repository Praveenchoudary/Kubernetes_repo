# ðŸ“‚ Kubernetes Namespaces

## ðŸ“˜ What Are Namespaces?

Namespaces are **virtual clusters** inside a Kubernetes cluster. They are used to **logically isolate and organize resources** such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.

- Names of resources must be unique **within a namespace**, but can be reused **across namespaces**.
- Namespace-based scoping is only applicable for namespaced objects.
- **Cluster-wide objects** like `StorageClass`, `Nodes`, `PersistentVolumes` are **not namespaced**.

## âœ… Why Use Namespaces?

Namespaces are essential for:

- Organizing a large number of Kubernetes resources.
- Creating **virtual clusters** for different **teams** or **projects**.
- Avoiding conflicts between different applications or environments.
- Applying **RBAC**, **network policies**, and **resource quotas** on a per-namespace basis.

## ðŸ’¡ Real-world Scenarios

### ðŸ”¸ Team-based Isolation

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eec1462c-6780-40f5-b04b-a2d82b13109a)

Assigning each team its own namespace:

- `team-a` â†’ managed by Team A
- `team-b` â†’ managed by Team B

> Teams cannot access or modify each otherâ€™s resources.  
> Cluster admins can set access limits using RBAC.

### ðŸ”¸ Environment Separation

Separate namespaces for different environments:

- `dev` â†’ for development
- `staging` â†’ for pre-production
- `prod` â†’ for production

> Dev testing wonâ€™t affect stable production workloads.

### ðŸ”¸ Logical Grouping

Group components based on their roles:

- `database` â†’ MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, etc.
- `monitoring` â†’ Prometheus, Grafana, etc.
- `application-services` â†’ Main application deployments and services.

## ðŸ“¦ Default Namespaces in Kubernetes

When a Kubernetes cluster is provisioned, the following namespaces are created by default:

| Namespace         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `default`         | Used when no other namespace is specified. |
| `kube-system`     | Holds system-critical pods like `kube-dns`, `kube-proxy`, etc. Do not use for personal resources. |
| `kube-public`     | Contains publicly readable data (readable without authentication). Mostly for cluster info. |
| `kube-node-lease` | Stores Lease objects used for node heartbeat checks by kubelet. Ensures node health detection. |

## ðŸš€ How to Work with Namespaces

### Create a Namespace

```bash
kubectl create namespace dev
