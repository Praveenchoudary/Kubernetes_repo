In Kubernetes, containers are deployed and managed within pods. A pod is the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that can be created, deployed, and managed. Here, you can use different container patterns within a single pod to achieve specific functionalities. Here are some common container patterns used in Kubernetes:

    Init Container
    Sidecar Container
    Ephemeral Container
    Multi Container

1. Init container

A Pod can have multiple containers running apps within it, but it can also have one or more init containers, which are run before the app containers are started. Init containers are designed to run initialization tasks before the main application container starts. They can be used for tasks like setting up configuration files, initializing databases, or waiting for external services to be ready. Init containers are exactly like regular containers, except:

    Init containers always run to completion.
    Each init container must complete successfully before the next one starts.
