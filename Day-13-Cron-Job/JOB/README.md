# 🚀 Kubernetes Job Example

## 🔹 What is a Job in Kubernetes?
A **Job** in Kubernetes is a workload resource used to run tasks that need to complete successfully once or a specific number of times, unlike Deployments (which run continuously).

- A Job ensures that the specified number of Pods run to completion.  
- If a Pod fails, the Job will retry until the task finishes.  
- Jobs are often used for **batch processing, data migration, backups, sending reports, etc.**

---

## 🔹 Real-Life Example of Kubernetes Job
👉 Imagine you’re running an **e-commerce application**. At midnight every day, you want to:

- Generate a **sales report** from your database.  
- Export the data to a file and upload it to AWS S3.  

This task doesn’t need to run 24/7. It only needs to run **once a day and complete successfully** → a Kubernetes **Job** is perfect for this.

## 🔹 Example Job YAML

Here’s a simple Job that runs a container to print `Hello Kubernetes Job` and exits:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: hello-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello
        image: busybox
        command: ["echo", "Hello Kubernetes Job"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 3
````

### ✅ Explanation:

* `restartPolicy: Never` → Don’t restart the Pod after it finishes.
* `backoffLimit: 3` → Retry up to 3 times if the Job fails.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Apply the Job:

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f job.yaml
   ```

2. Check Job status:

   ```sh
   kubectl get jobs
   ```

3. Get Pod logs:

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl logs <pod-name>
   ```

---

## 📌 Expected Output

Once the Job runs successfully, you should see:

```sh
Hello Kubernetes Job
```

The Job will complete and **not run again** unless restarted manually.

Do you also want me to extend this README with a **CronJob example** (for scheduled jobs like daily reports), so your repo covers **both Jobs and CronJobs**?
