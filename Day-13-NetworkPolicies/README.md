# Kubernetes Network Policies

Kubernetes Network Policies provide a robust mechanism to control the communication between pods and other network endpoints. They are essential for securing your applications by defining rules that specify how pods can communicate with each other and other network resources. In this hands-on guide, we will cover the fundamentals and demonstrate how to implement network policies with a practical example involving frontend and backend applications.


## 1. Introduction to Kubernetes Network Policies

Network Policies in Kubernetes are a crucial tool for securing your applications. They allow you to define rules that control how groups of pods can communicate with each other and other network resources. This is essential for isolating sensitive workloads and ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed within your cluster.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before diving into Kubernetes Network Policies, ensure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts.
- kubectl configured to interact with your cluster.
- A running Kubernetes cluster.

## 3. Understanding Network Policies

Network Policies are implemented using Kubernetes resources that define how pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. They use labels to select pods and define rules for ingress (incoming) and egress (outgoing) traffic.

### Key Concepts:

- **Pod Selector**: Selects the group of pods to which the policy applies.
- **Ingress Rules**: Define allowed incoming traffic.
- **Egress Rules**: Define allowed outgoing traffic.
- **Policy Types**: Can be either ingress, egress, or bot
