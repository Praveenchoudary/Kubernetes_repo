## 1️⃣ Voluntary vs Involuntary Disruptions

### Involuntary Disruptions 💥
These are **unexpected issues** you cannot control.

**Real-life analogy:** A restaurant kitchen:

- Chef drops soup (hardware failure) 🍲  
- Power goes out (node crash) ⚡  
- Stove breaks (kernel panic) 🔥  

**Kubernetes examples:**

- Node dies due to hardware failure  
- VM disappears (cloud/hypervisor failure)  
- Kernel panic or system crash  
- Node network partition disconnects from cluster  

**Mitigation:**

- Request proper CPU/memory for Pods  
- Run multiple replicas  
- Spread replicas across nodes/racks/zones  

---

### Voluntary Disruptions 🛠️
These are **planned actions** initiated by you or the admin.

**Real-life analogy:**  

- Close a stove for cleaning 🧹  
- Replace a chef 👨‍🍳➡️👩‍🍳  

**Kubernetes examples:**

- Updating or deleting a Deployment  
- Draining a node for maintenance/upgrade  
- Scaling down a cluster  

---

## 2️⃣ Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) 📊

**PDBs ensure high availability during voluntary disruptions.**

**Real-life analogy:** Online shop checkout counters:

- 3 counters (Pods)  
- PDB ensures **at least 2 counters open** at all times 🏪🏪  

**Example scenario:**

- 3 replica deployment: pod-a, pod-b, pod-c  
- PDB: minAvailable = 2  
- Admin drains node → only 1 pod is evicted at a time  
- Deployment ensures at least 2 Pods stay running

## 3️⃣ Pod Disruption Conditions ⚡

Pods can have **conditions indicating why they are disrupted**:

| Condition                     | Meaning                                                         | Example |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| PreemptionByScheduler        | Pod evicted for higher-priority pod                               | High-priority batch job |
| DeletionByTaintManager       | Pod deleted due to node taint                                      | Node running critical system task |
| EvictionByEvictionAPI        | Pod evicted via `kubectl drain`                                   | Node drained for upgrade |
| DeletionByPodGC              | Pod deleted because node disappeared                               | Cloud node crash |
| TerminationByKubelet         | Node pressure or graceful shutdown                                 | Node out-of-memory |

> These are useful for **Jobs/CronJobs** to handle failures gracefully ✅

## 4️⃣ Separation of Roles 👥

- **Application Owner:** Manages app logic, deployment, replicas  
- **Cluster Admin:** Manages cluster infra, upgrades, autoscaling  

**Analogy:**  

- Restaurant owner vs building manager 🏢  

PDBs act as the **interface between roles** to maintain availability.

## 5️⃣ Performing Disruptive Actions ⚙️

**Options for Cluster Admins:**

1. **Accept downtime** ⏸️ → Cheap, service unavailable  
2. **Failover** 🔄 → Switch traffic to backup cluster (expensive)  
3. **No downtime, use PDBs** ✅ → Upgrade nodes without affecting app availability  

**Analogy:** Upgrade kitchen appliances without closing the restaurant 🍳

| Concept                  | Real-life Example                                    |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Involuntary disruption    | Power outage, stove breaks in kitchen              |
| Voluntary disruption      | Cleaning a counter, updating chefs                  |
| PDB                       | At least 2 checkout counters must remain open      |
| Pod Disruption Conditions | Labels on Pods telling why they are evicted        |
| Separation of Roles       | Restaurant owner vs building manager               |
| Cluster Upgrade Strategy  | Upgrade nodes without closing the restaurant       |
