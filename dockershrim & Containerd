* **Before Kubernetes v1.24**, Kubernetes did **not talk directly to Docker Engine**.
* Instead, Kubernetes used a component called **dockershim** as a "bridge" or **adapter** between Kubernetes and Docker.
* Docker itself includes **containerd** internally, but Kubernetes didn’t talk to containerd directly — it went through dockershim to Docker.

### Example Scenario:

You run a Kubernetes cluster with **Kubernetes v1.20** on nodes with Docker installed.

* When you `kubectl apply` a pod manifest, Kubernetes talks to the **kubelet** on the node.
* The kubelet uses **dockershim** to communicate with the Docker Engine to start and manage containers.
* Docker manages the containers and images.
* Your containers run fine and you don’t worry about container runtime details.

## Real-Life Example of **containerd** in Kubernetes (Post Dockershim Removal)

### Context:

* From Kubernetes **v1.24+**, **dockershim is removed**.
* Kubernetes no longer supports Docker Engine directly.
* Instead, Kubernetes talks **directly to container runtimes** via the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**.
* The recommended runtime is **containerd** (which is a core container runtime used inside Docker).

### Example Scenario:

You run a Kubernetes cluster with **Kubernetes v1.27** on nodes configured to use **containerd**.

* When you deploy pods, kubelet talks **directly to containerd** via CRI.
* containerd manages container lifecycle: pulling images, starting/stopping containers, storage, networking.
* Docker is no longer involved at all.
* This reduces an extra layer (dockershim), improving performance and maintenance.

## What This Means for You in Real Life

| Aspect                 | With Dockershim (Docker Engine)                                   | With containerd (No Dockershim)  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Kubernetes version     | v1.23 and below                                                   | v1.24 and above                  |
| Container runtime used | Docker Engine (with dockershim adapter)                           | containerd directly              |
| Communication          | kubelet → dockershim → Docker Engine → containerd (inside Docker) | kubelet → containerd directly    |
| Runtime installation   | Install Docker Engine                                             | Install containerd standalone    |
| Maintenance            | Extra shim layer can cause complexity                             | Simpler and lighter architecture |
| Kubernetes CRI support | Dockershim deprecated, not maintained                             | Full native CRI support          |

## Quick Visual:

```text
Before (with dockershim):

kubelet <---> dockershim <---> Docker Engine <---> containerd (inside Docker)

After (without dockershim):

kubelet <---> containerd
```
